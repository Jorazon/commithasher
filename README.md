# Git Commit Hash Prefixer

Give your commit hashes leading zeroes!

Inspired by [Тsфdiиg's 𝕏 post](https://x.com/tsoding/status/1855713113221234836)

## TODO

- [ ] arg to give desired prefix instead of just current hard coded `000`
- [x] speed it up using `git commit-tree` instead of `git commit --amend`
- [x] speed it up by running spinner in parallel
